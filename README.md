# CAIN
is simulation software for high energy physics.

# Feature

- Classical interaction (orbit deformation) due to the Coulomb field.
- Luminosity between beams.
- Synchrotron radiation by electrons/positrons (beamstrahlung), and pair creation by high energy photons (coherent pair creation) due to the beam field.
